Node js is a used to write server side code 

NODE JS 
--> node js is a javascript runtime 
--> a tool for executing javascript code(outside browser)

--> Install node js 

--> Running javaScript file in terminal

    node file-name
    ex--> node app.js 

--> USING PACKAGE OF NODEJS IN JS 
    const a-name-for-package = require('package-name');
    ex-->
    const http = require('http');
    

--> creating server using node-js 

    const http = require('http')
    const server = http.createServer(handleRequest);//server created
    here handleRequest is a function which will be executed whenever we get a request or we want to send response

--> what is a port no. 
    amazon.com ==> send request to amazon's server 
    when working with network we have ports 
    every computer has different port no. --> it is like  a entry point for network traffic
    HTTP --> PORT NO. 80 
    HTTPS --> PORT NO. 443 
    for development --> use any other port no. like port no. 3000

--> LISTEN to port --> the server will listen to all request coming from this port 

    server.listen(3000);

--> function to handle incoming request and response to the request 

    function handleRequest(request, response) {

         //url is a property of request which stores the path
        if(request.url === '/currenttime'){
            response.statusCode = 200;
            response.end('<h1>'+ new Date().toISOString()+'</h1>')
        }
        else if(request.url === '/')
        {
           response.statusCode = 200;//a success status code 
           response.end("<h1>Hello World!</h1>");//response of server after success 
        }
    
    }

--> open localhost:3000  for server.listen(3000) in browser 

-->IMP STATUS CODE 
    200--> success! request parsed successfully, a response could be generted 
            + sent without any problems 
    404--> Client-side error! the requested resource/url was not found.
            hence the expected response could not be generated

    401 --> Client-side error! The requesting client(user) is not authorised to access
            the requested resource/url(e.g because not logged in)
    500--> Server-side error! The request was valid but something went wrong 
            on the server, hence the expected response could not be generated 

--> PATHS 
    
    localhost:3000/path 
    path should typically be all lowercase with no special character other than dashes
    It should also describe t
    


-->NODEMON PACKAGE -->  
        it will automatically start our server and stops it (basically it is helpful)
    --> install vis
         npm install nodemon --save-dev
    --> run nodemon 
        in package.json in "script" add "start":"nodemon app.js"
        "script":{
            "start":"nodemon app.js"
        }
    --> now in terminal just run 
        npm run start
