Node js is a used to write server side code 

NODE JS 
--> node js is a javascript runtime 
--> a tool for executing javascript code(outside browser)

--> Install node js 

--> Running javaScript file in terminal

    node file-name
    ex--> node app.js 

--> USING PACKAGE OF NODEJS IN JS 
    const a-name-for-package = require('package-name');
    ex-->
    const http = require('http');
    

--> creating server using node-js 

    const http = require('http')
    const server = http.createServer(handleRequest);//server created
    here handleRequest is a function which will be executed whenever we get a request or we want to send response

--> what is a port no. 
    amazon.com ==> send request to amazon's server 
    when working with network we have ports 
    every computer has different port no. --> it is like  a entry point for network traffic
    HTTP --> PORT NO. 80 
    HTTPS --> PORT NO. 443 
    for development --> use any other port no. like port no. 3000

--> LISTEN to port --> the server will listen to all request coming from this port 

    server.listen(3000);

--> function to handle incoming request and response to the request 

    function handleRequest(request, response) {
        response.statusCode = 200;
    }

-->IMP STATUS CODE 
    200--> success
